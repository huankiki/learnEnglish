 |-|-|-|
 |[Steve Job's Commencement Speech at Stanford](http://open.163.com/movie/2006/8/3/8/M7BC8JMHJ_M7BC8PA38.html)|乔布斯在斯坦福毕业典礼上的演讲| 听了N遍(整段&分段)，非常好的听力材料，内容也非常棒。<br>1. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. <br>2. Keep looking, don't settle. <br>3. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. <br>4. Stay hungury, Stay foolish.|
 |[Dan Gilbert：The surprising science of happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy)|TED Talk Year2004||
 |how.i.met.your.mother.s01e01|老爸老妈浪漫史第一季第一集|盲听>>看字幕听>>盲听>>反复听<br>英文字幕资源的Timeline有问题，Solution：中文字幕的Timeline + 英文字幕，用Python脚本完成这种形式的合成☺|
