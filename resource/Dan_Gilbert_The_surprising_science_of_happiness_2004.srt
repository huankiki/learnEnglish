1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,391
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,391
two million years seems like a really long time.

3
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:21,391
But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.

4
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,247
And yet in two million years,

5
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:27,391
the human brain has nearly tripled in mass,

6
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:30,987
going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

7
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,225
to the almost three-pound meatloaf

8
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:36,391
that everybody here has between their ears.

9
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:40,224
What is it about a big brain

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,849
that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?

11
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:46,391
Well, it turns out when brains triple in size,

12
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:49,727
they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.

13
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:54,391
And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part,

14
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:55,845
called the "frontal lobe."

15
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,497
Particularly, a part called the "pre-frontal cortex."

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,391
What does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify

17
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:06,121
the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull

18
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:08,546
in the blink of evolutionary time?

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,252
It turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things,

20
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:16,938
but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator.

21
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:20,391
Pilots practice in flight simulators

22
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,970
so that they don't make real mistakes in planes.

23
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:26,300
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation

24
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:29,391
that they can actually have experiences in their heads

25
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:32,037
before they try them out in real life.

26
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,694
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do,

27
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,957
and that no other animal can do quite like we can.

28
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,915
It's a marvelous adaptation.

29
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,391
It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language

30
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:46,391
as one of the things that got our species out of the trees

31
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,391
and into the shopping mall.

32
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,779
(Laughter)

33
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,391
All of you have done this.

34
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:56,391
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream,

35
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,701
and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."

36
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,391
It's because, without leaving your armchair,

37
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:06,822
you can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.

38
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,182
Let's see how your experience simulators are working.

39
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,826
Let's just run a quick diagnostic

40
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,883
before I proceed with the rest of the talk.

41
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:19,391
Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.

42
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:23,391
You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.

43
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:29,122
One of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.

44
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,876
And the other is becoming paraplegic.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,916
(Laughter)

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,824
Just give it a moment of thought.

47
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:37,657
You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.

48
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:41,391
Interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people,

49
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,391
data on how happy they are.

50
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:46,109
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?

51
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,391
But these aren't the data. I made these up!

52
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,605
These are the data.

53
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,391
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.

54
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:58,391
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs,

55
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:03,391
and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics

56
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,832
are equally happy with their lives.

57
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,908
Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz,

58
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:12,559
because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.

59
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,970
The research that my laboratory has been doing,

60
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,325
that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing,

61
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,524
has revealed something really quite startling to us,

62
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:23,391
something we call the "impact bias,"

63
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,869
which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly.

64
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:30,391
For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes

65
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,391
are more different than in fact they really are.

66
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:35,391
From field studies to laboratory studies,

67
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:40,457
we see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner,

68
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,391
getting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test,

69
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:50,311
on and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration

70
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:53,074
than people expect them to have.

71
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,881
This almost floors me --

72
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,391
a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people

73
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,391
suggests that if it happened over three months ago,

74
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,977
with only a few exceptions,

75
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,759
it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.

76
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,768
Why?

77
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:16,941
Because happiness can be synthesized.

78
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,251
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.

79
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:26,391
I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity.

80
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:31,361
I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."

81
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,574
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?

82
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,543
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.

83
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,459
Human beings have something

84
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,724
that we might think of as a "psychological immune system."

85
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:50,741
A system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes,

86
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:54,199
that help them change their views of the world,

87
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:55,620
so that they can feel better

88
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:58,572
about the worlds in which they find themselves.

89
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,462
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.

90
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:04,391
Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.

91
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:10,391
We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.

92
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,089
Now, you don't need me to give you

93
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:16,201
too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect.

94
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,849
Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence,

95
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:21,017
you don't have to look very far for evidence.

96
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,712
I took a copy of the New York Times

97
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,920
and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.

98
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:27,957
Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.

99
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,662
"I'm better off physically, financially, mentally ...

100
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:33,734
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."

101
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,690
"I believe it turned out for the best."

102
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,963
Who are these characters who are so damn happy?

103
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,357
The first one is Jim Wright.

104
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,252
Some of you are old enough to remember:

105
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:43,739
he was the chairman of the House of Representatives

106
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:45,135
and he resigned in disgrace

107
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,314
when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich

108
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:49,482
found out about a shady book deal he had done.

109
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,748
He lost everything.

110
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,550
The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything.

111
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,370
He lost his money, he lost his power.

112
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,682
What does he have to say all these years later?

113
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:00,445
"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally

114
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:02,270
and in almost every other way."

115
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,533
What other way would there be to be better off?

116
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:06,385
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?

117
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,123
He's pretty much covered them there.

118
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,628
Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of.

119
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:14,332
Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.

120
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:15,665
He was 78 years old.

121
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,612
He'd spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary

122
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,120
for a crime he didn't commit.

123
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,977
[He was ultimately released

124
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,270
for good behavior halfway through his sentence.]

125
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,270
What did he say about his experience?

126
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:29,852
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience." Glorious!

127
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,026
He is not saying,

128
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,446
"Well, there were some nice guys. They had a gym."

129
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,621
"Glorious,"

130
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,923
a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.

131
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:41,676
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known

132
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,409
but didn't, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper

133
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,399
about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds.

134
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,654
And he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"

135
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,361
So he went to find them. They said,

136
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:54,929
"We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."

137
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:58,193
Harry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker,

138
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,125
to loan him the $3,000, and his brother's immortal words were,

139
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,867
"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

140
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,380
He wouldn't lend him the money,

141
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:07,618
and of course, six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

142
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,836
It turns out people do eat hamburgers,

143
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,994
and Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.

144
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,842
And then, finally,

145
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,326
some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best,

146
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,493
who was the original drummer for the Beatles,

147
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:24,342
until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away

148
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,326
and picked up Ringo on a tour.

149
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,646
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed --

150
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,706
yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician --

151
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,237
he had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."

152
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,393
Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people,

153
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,292
and it is the secret of happiness.

154
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:42,689
Here it is, finally to be revealed.

155
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,935
First: accrue wealth, power, and prestige, then lose it.

156
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,611
(Laughter)

157
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,393
Second: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.

158
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,418
(Laughter)

159
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:56,672
Third: make somebody else really, really rich.

160
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,419
And finally: never ever join the Beatles.

161
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:00,467
(Laughter)

162
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:01,642
Yeah, right.

163
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,752
Because when people synthesize happiness,

164
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,970
as these gentlemen seem to have done,

165
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:09,773
we all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say,

166
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,333
"Yeah right, you never really wanted the job."

167
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:16,333
"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her,

168
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,453
and you figured that out just about the time

169
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,573
she threw the engagement ring in your face."

170
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:24,333
We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness

171
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:27,833
is not of the same quality as what we might call "natural happiness."

172
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,309
What are these terms?

173
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,737
Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted,

174
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:37,665
and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted.

175
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,665
And in our society, we have a strong belief

176
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:43,665
that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.

177
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,212
Why do we have that belief?

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,394
Well, it's very simple.

179
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:51,211
What kind of economic engine would keep churning

180
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:54,171
if we believed that not getting what we want

181
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,711
could make us just as happy as getting it?

182
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,767
With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard,

183
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,993
a shopping mall full of Zen monks

184
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,131
is not going to be particularly profitable,

185
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,757
because they don't want stuff enough.

186
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,862
(Laughter)

187
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,983
I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness

188
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,212
is every bit as real and enduring

189
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,887
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon

190
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:19,474
when you get exactly what you were aiming for.

191
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,274
I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric,

192
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:24,449
but by marinating you in a little bit of data.

193
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:27,419
Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used

194
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:31,625
to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks.

195
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,807
And this isn't mine.

196
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,807
It's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."

197
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:37,212
It's very simple.

198
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,942
You bring in, say, six objects,

199
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:43,227
and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.

200
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,809
In this case, because this experiment uses them,

201
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,212
these are Monet prints.

202
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,212
So, everybody can rank these Monet prints

203
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:52,236
from the one they like the most, to the one they like the least.

204
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,951
Now we give you a choice:

205
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,377
"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.

206
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,022
We're going to give you one as your prize to take home.

207
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:02,878
We happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject.

208
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,800
This is a bit of a difficult choice,

209
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:07,426
because neither one is preferred strongly to the other,

210
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,070
but naturally, people tend to pick number three

211
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,672
because they liked it a little better than number four.

212
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,104
Sometime later -- it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days --

213
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,212
the same stimuli are put before the subject,

214
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,941
and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.

215
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,942
"Tell us how much you like them now."

216
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,173
What happens?

217
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,166
Watch as happiness is synthesized.

218
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,212
This is the result that has been replicated over and over again.

219
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,227
You're watching happiness be synthesized.

220
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,743
Would you like to see it again?

221
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,212
Happiness!

222
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,475
"The one I got is really better than I thought!

223
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,212
That other one I didn't get sucks!"

224
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,379
That's the synthesis of happiness.

225
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,440
(Laughter)

226
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:46,513
Now, what's the right response to that?

227
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,211
"Yeah, right!"

228
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:51,212
Now, here's the experiment we did,

229
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,151
and I hope this is going to convince you

230
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,452
that "Yeah, right!" was not the right response.

231
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,698
We did this experiment with a group of patients

232
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,119
who had anterograde amnesia.

233
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:00,802
These are hospitalized patients.

234
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,991
Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,

235
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:05,015
a polyneuritic psychosis.

236
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:09,212
They drank way too much, and they can't make new memories.

237
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:13,149
OK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself,

238
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,366
and then leave the room,

239
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,644
when you come back, they don't know who you are.

240
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,497
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.

241
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,212
And we asked these patients to rank them

242
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:27,332
from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.

243
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:31,212
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four.

244
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:33,212
Like everybody else, they said,

245
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,903
"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print.

246
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,212
I'll take number three."

247
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,212
We explained we would have number three mailed to them.

248
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:44,212
We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room,

249
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,599
and counted to a half hour.

250
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:46,624
(Laughter)

251
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:50,132
Back into the room, we say, "Hi, we're back."

252
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,212
The patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,

253
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:55,973
I've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here.

254
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,997
If I've met you before, I don't remember."

255
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:01,212
"Really, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?"

256
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,832
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."

257
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,474
"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me

258
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:11,308
from the one you like the most to the one you like the least."

259
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:12,769
What do they do?

260
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:15,698
Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac.

261
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:19,713
We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own,

262
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:23,035
which one they chose last time, which one is theirs.

263
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,212
And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.

264
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:28,872
These are normal controls, where if I did this with you,

265
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:30,999
all of you would know which print you chose.

266
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:34,827
But if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue.

267
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:37,303
They can't pick their print out of a lineup.

268
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:42,212
Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness.

269
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:44,795
Right? This is the change in liking score,

270
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,326
the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.

271
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,029
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you;

272
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,212
now I'm showing it to you in graphical form --

273
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,373
"The one I own is better than I thought.

274
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,762
The one I didn't own, the one I left behind,

275
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,483
is not as good as I thought."

276
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,823
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.

277
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,657
These people like better the one they own,

278
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,926
but they don't know they own it.

279
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:15,116
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!

280
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,887
What these people did when they synthesized happiness

281
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,546
is they really, truly changed

282
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,037
their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.

283
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:29,212
They're not just saying it because they own it,

284
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,601
because they don't know they own it.

285
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:35,135
When psychologists show you bars,

286
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,714
you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.

287
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:42,047
And yet, all of us have this psychological immune system,

288
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,545
this capacity to synthesize happiness,

289
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,720
but some of us do this trick better than others.

290
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,777
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively

291
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,561
than other situations do.

292
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:58,386
It turns out that freedom,

293
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,736
the ability to make up your mind and change your mind,

294
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,315
is the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose

295
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,515
among all those delicious futures

296
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,022
and find the one that you would most enjoy.

297
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:11,798
But freedom to choose,

298
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,579
to change and make up your mind,

299
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,525
is the enemy of synthetic happiness.

300
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:19,595
And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows, of course.

301
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,801
"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?"

302
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,439
"My printer prints a blank page after every document."

303
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,439
"Why complain about getting free paper?"

304
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,739
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"

305
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:32,439
"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper!

306
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:35,239
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"

307
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,025
"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"

308
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,225
"What are you doing?"

309
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,804
"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed.

310
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:45,921
The psychological immune system works best

311
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:49,140
when we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.

312
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:51,545
This is the difference between dating and marriage.

313
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,139
You go out on a date with a guy,

314
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,799
and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.

315
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,997
You're married to a guy and he picks his nose?

316
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,503
He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake!

317
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:04,240
You find a way to be happy with what's happened.

318
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:05,265
(Laughter)

319
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,678
Now, what I want to show you

320
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:09,305
is that people don't know this about themselves,

321
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,607
and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.

322
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,608
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.

323
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,660
We created a black-and-white photography course,

324
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,139
and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.

325
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:24,497
So we gave them cameras; they went around campus;

326
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,878
they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors

327
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,092
and their dorm room and their dog,

328
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:32,234
and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.

329
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,784
They bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet;

330
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,103
they figure out which are the two best pictures;

331
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,809
and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms.

332
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,274
And they blow two of them up,

333
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,544
and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies

334
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,552
of meaningful things to them, and we say,

335
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,416
"Which one would you like to give up?"

336
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,591
"I have to give one up?"

337
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,727
"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project.

338
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,369
So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.

339
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:57,139
You get to keep one, and I get to keep one."

340
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:00,139
Now, there are two conditions in this experiment.

341
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:02,441
In one case, the students are told,

342
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:04,821
"But you know, if you want to change your mind,

343
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,698
I'll always have the other one here,

344
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:11,085
and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters" --

345
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:13,434
Yeah, "headquarters" --

346
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,139
"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

347
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:19,133
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email.

348
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:21,148
Better yet, I'll check with you.

349
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:24,060
You ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable."

350
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,981
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:

351
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:28,632
"Make your choice, and by the way,

352
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,649
the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.

353
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,395
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.

354
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,585
You will never see it again."

355
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,863
Half of the students in each of these conditions

356
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,299
are asked to make predictions

357
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:43,934
about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep

358
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,639
and the picture they leave behind.

359
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,570
Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms

360
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:51,705
and they are measured over the next three to six days

361
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:54,004
on their liking, satisfaction with the pictures.

362
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:55,220
And look at what we find.

363
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:58,368
First of all, here's what students think is going to happen.

364
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,192
They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose

365
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,705
a little more than the one they left behind,

366
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,789
but these are not statistically significant differences.

367
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:11,477
It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter

368
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,469
whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.

369
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,705
Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening.

370
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:22,126
Both right before the swap and five days later,

371
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,336
people who are stuck with that picture,

372
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,512
who have no choice,

373
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,576
who can never change their mind,

374
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,932
like it a lot!

375
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,705
And people who are deliberating -- "Should I return it?

376
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:35,944
Have I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn't the good one?

377
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,560
Maybe I left the good one?" -- have killed themselves.

378
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,021
They don't like their picture,

379
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,878
and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired,

380
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,995
they still don't like their picture.

381
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,169
Why?

382
00:17:46,193 --> 00:17:50,188
Because the [reversible] condition is not conducive

383
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:51,960
to the synthesis of happiness.

384
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,872
So here's the final piece of this experiment.

385
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:58,705
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students

386
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:02,085
and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course,

387
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,681
and we can do it one of two ways.

388
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:06,958
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures,

389
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:08,981
you'd have four days to change your mind,

390
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,878
or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures

391
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:14,985
and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.

392
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,055
Which course would you like to be in?" Duh!

393
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,705
66 percent of the students, two-thirds,

394
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:23,705
prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.

395
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,705
Hello? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course

396
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:31,705
in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture.

397
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:37,705
Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.

398
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:43,657
The Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here

399
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,705
but he's making it hyperbolically:

400
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,705
"'Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so."

401
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:52,168
It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.

402
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,705
Is there really nothing good or bad?

403
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:58,078
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris

404
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,713
are just the same thing?

405
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:00,824
(Laughter)

406
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,705
That seems like a one-question IQ test.

407
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,705
They can't be exactly the same.

408
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,705
In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth,

409
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,103
was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.

410
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,082
This is worth contemplating:

411
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:19,058
"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life

412
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,705
seems to arise from overrating the difference

413
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:24,705
between one permanent situation and another --

414
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:30,026
Some of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others,

415
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,979
but none of them can deserve to be pursued

416
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:37,447
with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules

417
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,066
either of prudence or of justice,

418
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,855
or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds,

419
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:46,416
either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly,

420
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,512
or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice."

421
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:55,268
In other words: yes, some things are better than others.

422
00:19:55,292 --> 00:20:00,795
We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.

423
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:04,600
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast

424
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,315
because we have overrated the difference between these futures,

425
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,308
we are at risk.

426
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:14,617
When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully.

427
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,513
When our ambition is unbounded,

428
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:20,951
it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others,

429
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,974
to sacrifice things of real value.

430
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:25,015
When our fears are bounded,

431
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,174
we're prudent, we're cautious,

432
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:28,409
we're thoughtful.

433
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,668
When our fears are unbounded and overblown,

434
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:33,718
we're reckless, and we're cowardly.

435
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:37,795
The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data,

436
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,898
is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown,

437
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:48,094
because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity

438
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:52,537
we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.

439
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,712
Thank you.

440
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:58,661
(Applause)
