00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,950
跟着我在这里转一圈 朗耶尔城（挪威城市）
Come take a walk with me around Longyearbyen.

1
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,520
那是挪威斯瓦尔巴群岛上最大的城镇。
That's the largest town on the Norwegian islands of Svalbard.

2
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,420
其中某些场景可能看上去很熟悉。
Parts of it may loo k familiar.

3
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,230
但毫无疑问
But make no mistake,

4
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,330
这个地方是与众不同的
this place is different.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,840
北纬七十八度
At seventy eight degrees North,

6
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:53,220
它离北极只有八百英里或13公里
it is just eight hundred miles or thirteen hundred kilometers from the North Pole.

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,690
有超过二千的常住居民
And with over two thousand permanent residents,

8
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,900
它是地球上最北部的城镇。
it is the northernmost real town on Earth.

9
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,700
公路总长仅有50公里
There are only fifty kilometers of road,

10
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,190
包括房子之间的小街道
including the small streets between houses,

11
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,930
所以人们在这里
so people get around the island,

12
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,220
主要是通过雪地摩托出行
mainly on snowmobile.

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,150
事实上
In fact,

14
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,390
这里注册的雪地摩托比居民还多
there are more registered snowmobiles than residents.

15
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,470
任何人离开小镇的时候都需要随身携带一把枪，并且要知道如何使用
Anyone leaving town is required to travel with a gun and someone who knows how to use it.

16
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,440
因为这些岛屿也是北极熊的家园。
Because the islands are also home to polar bears.

17
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,770
白天的平均气温低于零度
The average daytime high is below freezing for all,

18
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,330
但一年中的四个月
but four months of the year.

19
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,790
从十月末到二月中旬
And from the end of October to mid February,

20
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,980
太阳都不会升起
the sun doesn't rise at all.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,460
这是一个漫长的极地之夜
This is the long polar night.

22
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,310
住在这里很困难
Living here is tough.

23
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,920
去年12月
This past December,

24
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,130
城里的雪崩摧毁了十户人家
an avalanche in town destroyed ten homes,

25
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,600
以前就是在这里
which used to be here.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,700
两人失去了生命
Killing two people.

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,250
那么 这个寒冷的遥远的冰雪覆盖的群岛是如何居住的呢
So how did this cold remote ice covered Archipelago come to be inhabited?

28
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:42,240
城镇周围的山丘蕴藏着丰富的煤矿 已经开采了一百多年
The hills around town are rich in coal deposits that have been mined for over a hundred years.

29
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,850
煤是通过一系列的空中运输方式运到港口的
The coal was transported to the port by a series of aerial tramways,

30
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,710
其中一些仍然存在
some of which remain today,

31
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,690
尽管他们已经不再使用了
though they are no longer operational.

32
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,650
煤炭是一个提醒，它的斯瓦尔巴特群岛并不总是北极的冰世界。
Coal is a reminder that its Svalbard was not always an Arctic ice world.

33
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,680
3.6亿年前 它实际上是在热带地区
Three hundred and sixty million years ago it was actually in the tropics,

34
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,750
就在赤道以北
just north of the equator,

35
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:16,290
一个沼泽区 上面覆盖着现代蕨类植物的前体细胞
a swampy area it was covered with the precursors to modern ferns,

36
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,510
它们比现在大得多
which were much larger than they are today.

37
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,910
高度达到10到30米
reaching ten to thirty meters in height.

38
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,840
然后 这些植被被泥土和沙子覆盖 淹没在海底
This vegetation was then covered in mud and sand and submerged under the sea.

39
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,540
随着时间的推移
Over time,

40
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:35,580
它变成了20世纪从挪威带来矿工的煤矿
it turned into the coal deposits that in the twentieth century brought miners from Norway,

41
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,140
俄罗斯和美国
Russia and the US.

42
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,240
大多数煤矿现在已经关闭 经济正逐渐转向旅游业
Most of the coal mines have now closed and the economy is gradually shifting towards tourism,

43
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,920
教育和研究
education and research.

44
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,260
游客们乘坐雪地摩托和狗雪橇旅行
The tourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds.

45
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,790
在斯瓦尔巴有一个大学中心
There is a university centre in Svalbard,

46
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,550
它提供生物学的学期课程
which offers semester courses in biology,

47
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,140
物理和地质学
physics and geology.

48
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,710
在山的一侧是斯瓦尔巴全球种子库。
And up on the side of a mountain is the Svalbard global seed vault.

49
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,050
但这是另一个时代的故事
But that's a story for another time.

50
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,930
当地人告诉我 来自不同国家的地区对该地区的兴趣正在增加
The locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations is increasing.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,160
随着全球变暖 北极冰层缩小
As the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks,

52
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,500
整个北部的贸易路线正在开放
trade routes are opening up across the North.

53
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,410
斯瓦尔巴特群岛被战略性地安置在北美，
And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America,

54
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,580
亚洲和欧洲
Asia and Europe.

55
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,240
所以在未来的某一天，
So one day in the future,

56
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:02,700
斯瓦尔巴群岛可能不再像以前那样寒冷或遥远。
Svalbard may no longer be as cold or as remote as it once was.

57
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,380
但现在它提醒我们
But for now it is a reminder of how,

58
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,270
通过我们的聪明才智
through our ingenuity,

59
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:19,620
人们可以住在最不适宜居住的地方
people can live in the most inhospitable of places.
